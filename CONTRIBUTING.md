# Contributing

claude-relay is a solo-maintained project. Contributions are welcome, but please follow these guidelines to keep things manageable.

## Bug fixes and typos

Go ahead and open a PR. No issue required.

## Feature requests

Open an issue first. Describe the problem you're trying to solve, not the solution. I'll respond with whether it fits the project direction.

**Do not open a feature PR without an approved issue.** It will be closed, regardless of quality. This isn't personal — I need to keep the project focused.

## Before you PR

- Keep PRs small and focused. One change per PR.
- Test your changes locally.
- Follow the existing code style.
- No dependency additions without prior discussion.

## What I won't merge

- Features that conflict with the project philosophy (zero install, no cloud, no account)
- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Changes that add external service dependencies
- PRs that bundle multiple unrelated changes

## Questions?

Open an issue. I'm happy to discuss ideas.
